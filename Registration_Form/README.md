<h1>Explanation - HTML Code:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    The code starts with the HTML5 doctype declaration, indicating that it is an HTML document.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element contains metadata information for the webpage.
  </li>
  <li>
    The metadata includes setting the character encoding to UTF-8 and defining the title of the webpage as "Registration Form."
  </li>
  <li>
    The webpage includes an external CSS file linked with <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to apply styles from the "styles.css" file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, there is an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading element with the text "Registration Form." This represents the main heading of the form.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element follows the heading, providing a message to users to fill out the form with the required information.
  </li>
  <li>
    The form is defined using the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element. It has the "post" method and the "action" attribute set to "https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" to handle form submissions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside the form, there are multiple <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> elements that group related form fields together.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> contains four <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements associated with input fields.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each label has an associated input element. For example, "Enter Your First Name:" has an input with the ID "first-name," name "first-name," and type "text," which is required for form submission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, there are input fields for the last name, email, and new password, each with appropriate attributes for data entry and validation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The second <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> contains three radio input options and a checkbox for account type selection and accepting the terms and conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The third <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> contains various form elements, such as a file input for uploading a profile picture, a number input for age, a dropdown menu (<code>&lt;select&gt;</code>) to select how the user heard about the service, and a textarea for providing a bio.
  </li>
  <li>
    The webpage includes a submit button with <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> to allow users to submit the form.
  </li>
</ul>

Overall, this HTML code defines a registration form with multiple fields for user input, such as personal information, account type, profile picture, age, referrer information, and a bio. Users are required to fill in specific fields, and the form will be submitted to the specified URL upon submission.
