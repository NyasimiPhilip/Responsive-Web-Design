The code begins with the HTML doctype declaration, indicating that it is an HTML5 document.

The <html> tag encloses the entire HTML document, and the lang attribute is set to "en," indicating that the document is written in English.

The <head> element contains metadata information, including:

<meta charset="utf-8">: This specifies the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters from different languages.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This sets the viewport width to the device's width and the initial zoom scale to 1.0. It helps ensure that the webpage displays correctly on different devices with varying screen sizes.
The <title> element within the <head> element sets the title of the webpage to "Colored Markers."

The <link> element is used to link an external CSS file named "styles.css" to the HTML document. This file likely contains additional styles for the webpage.

Inside the <body> element, there is an <h1> heading element with the text "CSS Color Markers." This represents the main heading of the webpage.

The <div> element with a class of "container" is a block-level container that wraps the marker elements.

There are three <div> elements with the class "marker," each representing a colored marker. They are styled using CSS classes "red," "green," and "blue."

Each "marker" <div> contains two nested <div> elements:

<div class="cap">: This represents the cap of the marker.
<div class="sleeve">: This represents the sleeve/body of the marker.
